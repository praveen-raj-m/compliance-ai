PURPOSE These procedures establish the key steps to follow for development and approval of EPA data standards. 2. SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY These procedures apply to all EPA organizations and their contractors engaged in the design, development, operation, or maintenance of Agency information and information systems or applications. 3. AU DIENCE The audience for these procedures includes all EPA programs, regions, laboratories, and offices and contractors developing and maintaining systems for the Agency. 4. BACKGROUND Data standards are documented agreements on the format and definition of common data. Consistent use of data standards across the enterprise and with our information exchange partners promotes the efficient sharing of information. Common terminology and data element definitions enables the integration of databases, promotes environmental assessment and analysis of data from disparate sources, improves data integrity, and maximizes the use of shared resources. As stated in the Data Standards Policy, EPA shall develop, implement, maintain and oversee two types of data standards: 1. Data exchange within an EPA program office, by two or more EPA offices, between EPA and federal agencies, or between EPA and international partners. These data standards are developed, approved, and promulgated by EPA according to the Chief Information Officer (CIO) mandated approval process. 2. Data exchange with partners across the Exchange Network. These standards are developed, approved, and promulgated through the Exchange Network in collaboration with Network partners and promulgated by EPA according to the CIO mandated approval process. EPA shall use Exchange Network Data standards in Exchange Network data exchange flows and tools. The development and maintenance of Exchange Network standards is governed under the policies and procedures of the Exchange Network and not by these procedures.

Programs (IMOs) and regions (IRM BCs) are notified of the development process and offered an opportunity for involvement. 2. CIO [designee] authorizes the creation of a data standard action team. 3. The office or region and DSB creates an action team from the community of interest. 4. Data standard action team opens a controlled collaborative space on the data standards Web site for action team deliberations, document sharing, and threaded discussions. 5. Data standard action team develops a charter outlining the scope of work and level of effort. 6. DSB trains data standard action team in data standards development and in the use of the approved data standards template. 7. Data standard action team develops draft data standard. c. Draft Data Standards Review Procedures 1. Data standard action team posts the draft data standard on the controlled collaborative space and on the data standards Web site for review. 2. Data standard action team notifies community of interest that draft data standard is available for review. 3. Data standard action team reviews comments from community of interest and develops a matrix for resolution. 4. Data standard action team resolves comments and notifies submitters. 5. Data standard action team develops implementation guidance or, if the standard was developed through the Exchange Network process, the EPA members of the Exchange Network data standards development action team develop implementation guidance (see Data Standards Implementation Procedures). The implementation guidance must include a \"required implementation date\", all relevant systems in EPA must implement the data standard by this date. 6. Data standard action team forwards draft through the Quality Information Council (QIC) process to the CIO for approval for submission for public comment. 7. CIO [designee] approves draft for public comment. Page 3 of 5 EPA Classification No.: 2128.0-P-01.0 CIO Approval Date: 06/28/07 CIO Transmittal No.: 07-002 Review Date: 06/2010 8. DSB publishes a federal register notice if standard affects external data exchanges with links to the standard on the data standards web site. 9. Data standard action team reviews pubic comments and develops a comment matrix for resolution. 10. Data standard action team resolves comments and notifies submitters. 11. Data standard action team forwards revised draft data standard and implementation guidance to QIC for recommendation to CIO. d. Data Standard Approval Procedures 1. Quality Information Council (QIC) reviews and sends draft data standard and the implementation guidance to CIO with recommendation. 2. CIO approves and promulgates final data standard and implementation guidance. 3. DSB publishes final data standard and implementation guidance on appropriate Web sites and registers data standard in the Environmental Data Registry (EDR). 7. RELATED DOCUMENTS None 8.
