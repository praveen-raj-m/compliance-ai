National bodies that are members of ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further maintenance are described in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1. In particular, the different approval criteria needed for the different types of document should be noted.

The adoption of an information security management system is a strategic decision for an organization. The establishment and implementation of an organization\u2019s information security management system is influenced by the organization\u2019s needs and objectives, security requirements, the organizational processes used and the size and structure of the organization. All of these influencing factors are expected to change over time. The information security management system preserves the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information by applying a risk management process and gives confidence to interested parties that risks are adequately managed. It is important that the information security management system is part of and integrated with the organization\u2019s processes and overall management structure and that information security is considered in the design of processes, information systems, and controls. It is expected that an information security management system implementation will be scaled in accordance with the needs of the organization. This document can be used by internal and external parties to assess the organization's ability to meet the organization\u2019s own information security requirements. The order in which requirements are presented in this document does not reflect their importance or imply the order in which they are to be implemented. The list items are enumerated for reference purpose only. ISO/IEC 27000 describes the overview and the vocabulary of information security management systems, referencing the information security management system family of standards (including ISO/IEC 27003[2], ISO/IEC 27004[3] and ISO/IEC 27005[4]), with related terms and definitions."}
